    "reasoning": "I am unable to see the content of the analysis reports, as they appear as [object Object] and lack any concrete data or analysis. Without specific information about economic indicators, historical trends, or expert forecasts, I cannot assign a data-driven probability to the 'yes' or 'no' outcome for the KXCPIYOY-25JUL-T3.0 market. In this absence of evidence, I conservatively assign an even 50% probability to both outcomes, as there is no basis to favor one over the other."
