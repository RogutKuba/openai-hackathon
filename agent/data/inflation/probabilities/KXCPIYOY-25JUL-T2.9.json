Without being able to review the actual reports, their contents, or the evidence they provide, I cannot make an informed or evidence-based assessment of this market outcome. Therefore, the only conservative and fair assignment of probability is 50% yes and 50% no, reflecting complete uncertainty with no supporting or opposing evidence available."
