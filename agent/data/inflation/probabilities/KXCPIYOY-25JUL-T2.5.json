Without access to the specific evidence and data presented in these reports, I cannot provide a well-founded probability estimate for the market outcome KXCPIYOY-25JUL-T2.5. In the absence of any supporting or opposing information, the best conservative stance is to assign equal probabilities to both outcomes until further, concrete information can be reviewed."
