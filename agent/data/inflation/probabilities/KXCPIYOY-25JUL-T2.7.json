    "reasoning": "The provided analysis reports are not accessible ('[object Object]'), so there is no concrete evidence available to base a well-founded probability assessment. In the absence of relevant data or analysis—such as historical CPI trends, economic forecasts, or expert analysis—the only justifiable conservative estimate is a 50/50 probability. If actual report contents were available, these could substantially shift the assigned probabilities based on their data quality and conclusions."
