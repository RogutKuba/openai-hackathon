    "reasoning": "It appears that the analysis reports intended to guide my assessment were not included or were improperly formatted (shown as [object Object]). Without access to the actual content of these reports, I cannot reliably assess the market outcome or weigh the supporting and opposing evidence as required. Thus, I must assign a neutral probability of 50% to both 'yes' and 'no' outcomes in the absence of specific evidence, as a conservative baseline. Please provide the actual analysis reports or more information for a more accurate evaluation."
