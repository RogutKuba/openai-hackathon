    "reasoning": "I am unable to analyze the reports because the content provided for the 'Analysis Reports' is '[object Object]' and does not contain any textual or numerical evidence. Without the actual content of the reports, I cannot assess supporting or opposing evidence, nor can I evaluate the strength or reliability of data sources. As a result, I must conservatively assign an even 50/50 probability split for 'yes' and 'no' outcomes, pending the availability of the actual reports for review."
