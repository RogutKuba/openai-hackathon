## Summary of Latest and Historical US CPI YoY Inflation Rates (Seasonally Adjusted)

### Recent Year-Over-Year (YoY) Inflation Trends (Apr 2023–Apr 2025)
- **April 2023:** 4.95%
- **July 2023:** 3.28%
- **December 2023:** 3.32%
- **April 2024:** 3.35%
- **July 2024:** 2.94%
- **December 2024:** 2.87%
- **April 2025:** 2.33%

  The annual inflation rate as of April 2025 (latest in this dataset) was approximately **2.33%**. Over the past year, there has been a clear **deceleration** in inflation, with most twelve-month changes between 2.3% and 3.7%. This marks a continued transition from the high post-pandemic inflation seen in 2021-2022, when YoY rates exceeded 6%.

### Long-Term Perspective (1948–2025)
- **Average YoY Inflation Rate (since 1948):** ~3.52%
- **Maximum YoY Inflation:** 14.59% (stagflation era of late 1970s–early 1980s)
- **Minimum YoY Inflation:** -2.99% (periods of deflation, e.g., after WWII and briefly during the 2008-09 financial crisis)

### Trajectory and Projections Towards July 2025
- Recent monthly readings show a continued **downtrend**, and by April 2025 CPI growth is around the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%.
- If present trends continue, the July 2025 CPI YoY rate is expected to remain in the 2.3–2.7% range, barring any external shocks (e.g., energy price spikes, supply chain disruptions).
- This range is supported by consensus forecasts from major banks, the Federal Reserve's SEP (Summary of Economic Projections), and market-based measures (e.g., breakeven inflation rates), which generally expect US inflation to normalize near the Fed's 2% target in 2025.

### Key Insights
- **Rapid Disinflation:** The post-pandemic US inflation surge has largely receded, with annual CPI increases now close to their long-term average and recent low.
- **Monetary Policy Implication:** The downtrend strengthens the case for the Fed to hold or potentially cut rates in H2 2025, provided core inflation also moderates.
- **Risks:** Upside inflation risks remain from possible energy price volatility, wage pressures, or renewed supply chain issues.

### Recommendations
- **Businesses and policymakers** should plan for a near-"normal" inflation environment in 2025, but hedge for temporary swings.
- **Investors** may see less urgency for inflation-protected assets as the trajectory supports moderating price changes.
