### Key Insights

1. **Downward Trend:** The Sticky Core CPI has shown a persistent, gradual decline from a recent high of almost 6% YoY in mid-2023 to just above 3% expected by spring 2025.

2. **Sticky Prices Lag Headline CPI:** The slow rate of decline reflects the inherent "stickiness" in the underlying basket. Even as headline inflation may fall more sharply, sticky prices decline slowly.

3. **Implications for July 2025:** Based on the recent trend (average monthly decline of ~0.10-0.15 percentage points), projections suggest that the Sticky Core CPI YoY will likely be near or slightly below 3% by July 2025, barring any major macroeconomic shifts.

4. **Broader Macro Outlook:** Persistent but easing sticky inflation supports the view that core inflation pressures are abating but are far from the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, which means monetary policy may stay restrictive into 2025.

### Relevance to Original Query
- **Historical perspective:** The series confirms that sticky underlying inflation has been more persistent than the headline rate, as seen in the slow, steady decrease.
- **Expectations for July 2025:** The Sticky Price CPI less Food and Energy is expected to decline further into the 3% range, but the process is slow. Forecasts for the main CPI may show sharper moves, but sticky-core provides a more reliable gauge of underlying trend inflation.

### Actionable Recommendations
- **For Policymakers:** Monitor Sticky Core CPI as an anchor to gauge broad-based inflation persistence and the effectiveness of tight monetary policy.
- **For Investors:** Expect gradual relief in inflationary pressures but continued caution regarding interest rate and bond market expectations into 2025.

**Caveat:** All projections assume no major external inflation shocks or policy changes.
