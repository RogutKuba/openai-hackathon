## Median CPI Year-over-Year Analysis: 2019 to 2025

### Historical Overview (2019–2022)
- **2019 (pre-pandemic):** Median CPI year-over-year (YoY) inflation was stable, mostly between 2.5% and 3.2%, reflecting a period of moderate, consistent inflation.
- **2020 (pandemic impact):** Early 2020 saw relative stability, but the YoY rate dropped as low as 1.14% (Sep 2020) during initial pandemic disinflation. Inflation rebounded quickly; by July 2020, rates had risen above 3%.
- **2021 (recovery):** Inflation accelerated dramatically from mid-2021, hitting 4.11% in August and peaking at 6.91% in October, coinciding with strong demand recovery and supply constraints.
- **2022 (high inflation):** The median CPI reached new highs, with peak rates above 8% (June 2022). The inflation rate stayed above 6% through year-end, marking one of the highest sustained inflation episodes in decades.

### Recent Trends (2023–2024)
- **2023:** The inflation trend showed volatility, with periods of re-acceleration (7.15% in Feb 2023) but overall moving toward moderation. By the second half of 2023, the median CPI declined, reaching 3.23% in July but bouncing back above 4% in the fall.
- **2024 (to April):** The first half of 2024 continued the downward trend, with rates dropping to as low as 2.5%-2.8% in May–June. Projections see volatility into the latter half, with a slight renewed rise (e.g., 4.14% in Sep 2024), possibly reflecting persistent service inflation or new supply-side shocks.

### Projections & Outlook (Mid-2024 to Mid-2025)
- Median CPI projections for July 2025 as per the current data trajectory (with latest available value April 2025 at 3.98%) suggest median inflation will continue trending downward, but at a level above the pre-pandemic 2% target:
    - **Q3 2024:** Projected to oscillate between 2.6% and 4.1%.
    - **2025:** Early monthly projections indicate values around 3.5–4.0%, with no clear sign of a rapid return to the 2% target.
    - **Implication:** The data points to a "sticky" structural inflation environment, where median inflation remains above the pre-pandemic norm, likely due to entrenched underlying service and wage pressures.

### Key Insights Relevant to CPI Forecasting
- **Median CPI as a Core Indicator:** Median CPI is designed to strip out volatile outliers from the inflation basket, making it a better signal of underlying inflation than the headline CPI. Its persistence at elevated rates signals broad-based underlying price pressures, not driven solely by energy or food shocks.
- **Persistent, Elevated Inflation:** Despite headline CPI dropping faster, the median CPI's stickiness suggests core inflation pressures (like services and wages) are still elevated.
- **Policy Implications:** If the median CPI remains above 3% through mid-2025, the Fed may face pressure to delay rate cuts, supporting a “higher for longer” stance.

### Final Takeaways for July 2025 Latest Release
- **Median CPI is projected to be around 3.5–4.0% YoY.**
- **Underlying inflation may remain stubbornly above target.**
- **The broad trend is toward moderation, but not a return to pre-pandemic norms.**

### Recommendation for Watchers
- Monitor subsequent monthly releases for signs of further moderation—particularly if readings consistently fall below 3%.
- Watch for divergence between median and headline measures, as this would indicate whether inflation is still broad-based or becoming more concentrated in specific sectors.
