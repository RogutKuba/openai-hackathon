# US CPI Year-over-Year Inflation Rates: Historical Analysis, Latest Trends, and July 2025 Outlook

## Executive Summary

- **Latest headline CPI YoY (April 2025):** 2.33% (seasonally adjusted), steadily down from 4.95% in April 2023.
- **Projection for July 2025:** Headline CPI YoY likely in the 2.3–2.7% range, near the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
- **Sticky CPI (core, less food and energy):** Still elevated but falling, projected to reach near/below 3% by July 2025.
- **Median CPI:** Signaling persistent underlying inflation, likely 3.5–4.0% YoY by July 2025, indicating broad-based but gradually moderating pressures.
- **Historical context:** After peaking post-pandemic, all core inflation measures are trending lower, but core/median inflation remains notably above pre-pandemic norms.

**Conclusion:** US inflation is returning toward "normal," but underlying measures suggest persistent price pressures; monetary policy is likely to remain somewhat restrictive through mid-2025.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **FRED CPIAUCSL:** Headline CPI for All Urban Consumers (seasonally adjusted)
- **FRED CORESTICKM159SFRBATL:** Sticky-Price CPI (excludes food/energy; slow-changing items, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)
- **FRED MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE:** Median CPI (from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)
- **Projections:** Consensus from the Fed, financial institutions, and market-based inflation expectations (as of Q2 2024)

### Analytical Approach
- Computed and compared YoY inflation rates from 2019 through projected values for July 2025.
- Evaluated headline, sticky, and median CPI to diagnose both headline and underlying trend inflation.
- Examined historical highs/lows for context, and cross-referenced with policy outlooks and market expectations.

### Time Period Covered
- Long-run: 1948–2025 (headline inflation averages)
- Detailed trend: 2019–April 2025
- Projections: to July 2025

## Key Findings

### 1. Headline Inflation
- **Deceleration:** CPI YoY fell from almost 5% in April 2023 to 2.33% by April 2025.
- **Historical average:** ~3.5% since 1948 (range: -3% to +14.6%).
- **Projection:** Stabilization around the Fed's 2% target, barring new shocks.

### 2. Core (Sticky) Inflation
- **Persistent but Easing:** Sticky core CPI YoY dropped from nearly 6% (mid-2023) to just over 3% (projected for summer 2025).
- **Slow to Adjust:** These basket components lag headline inflation declines.

### 3. Median Inflation
- **Structural Stickiness:** Median CPI peaked above 8% (mid-2022), remains stubbornly elevated (3.5–4.0% projected for July 2025).
- **Signal:** Suggests broad underlying inflation pressures (services, wages).

### 4. Policy and Market Implications
- **Disinflation gives Fed leeway:** Case for rate cuts grows, but sticky measures support "higher for longer" stance.
- **Risks:** Energy, wages, and supply chains could re-accelerate inflation, especially for underlying/core measures.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Headline US CPI Trends (FRED CPIAUCSL)
- **Pandemic/Recovery:** Inflation surged 2021–2022 (peaks above 6%).
- **Recent Deceleration:** Downtrend began in 2023, with most recent 12-month readings (2024-2025) between 2.3% and 3.7%.
- **April 2025 YoY:** 2.33%, near Fed target.
- **Projection for July 2025:** Likely 2.3–2.7%. Driven by continued resolution of post-COVID shocks and stable energy prices.

### 2. Sticky Price CPI (CORESTICKM159SFRBATL)
| Month     | Sticky CPI YoY (%) |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 2023-05   | 5.98               |
| 2024-04   | 4.40               |
| 2024-12   | 3.75 (proj.)        |
| 2025-04   | 3.18 (proj.)        |

- **Trend:** Persistent, gradual easing, still above headline.
- **Implication:** Indicates deeper-seated inflation is slower to dissipate—Fed will view as a reason for caution on policy easing.

### 3. Median CPI (MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE)
- **Pre-pandemic:** 2.5–3.2% (2019)
- **Pandemic drop:** To 1.14% (Sep 2020)
- **Rapid climb:** Above 8% (mid-2022)
- **2023–2024 moderation:** Receding, but consistently above 3%.
- **April 2025:** 3.98%
- **Projection for July 2025:** 3.5–4.0%
- **Takeaway:** Median inflation, a key signal of broad-based price pressures, sees a slow improvement but is not yet close to pre-pandemic levels or the Fed's 2% target.

### Comparative Insight
- **Headline drops quickly; core and median lag.** Underlying basket composition means the CPI headline is more sensitive to energy/food shocks, while median and sticky measures show progress on deeply embedded inflation is slow.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Summary
- **US headline inflation is returning to normal**, validating that the disinflation process is largely complete for the broader CPI basket.
- **Underlying inflation (sticky/median) remains above target,** suggesting persistent service and wage pressures.
- **Fed likely to maintain restrictive stance,** possibly delaying rate cuts until underlying measures fall more decisively.

### Actionable Insights
- **Policymakers:** Monitor median and sticky CPI closely as headline falls; wait for sustained core disinflation before easing policy further.
- **Businesses and Investors:** Prepare for a low-inflation environment, but hedge against potential supply-side shocks or wage/energy surges.
- **Future Watch:** July 2025 CPI will be a key test—sustained sub-3% prints across all core measures would confirm durable progress.

### Future Considerations
- **Watch volatility in food/energy,** which can quickly reaccelerate headline inflation.
- **Track wage growth and rent/service prices** for sticky inflation clues.
- **Stay alert to global macro shocks:** Geopolitical, supply chain, or energy disruptions could derail the baseline scenario.

**Confidence Level:** High for July 2025 projections in the absence of large, unforeseen shocks. Sticky and median measures increase certainty in the disinflation process, but underscore the lingering inflation challenge in core categories.
