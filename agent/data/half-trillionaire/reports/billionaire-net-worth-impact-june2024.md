# Executive Summary
Recent market volatility in June 2024 has had significant impacts on the net worth of the world’s top billionaires, particularly those tied to major public companies such as Tesla, Amazon, and LVMH. Sudden swings in large-cap stocks and sector-specific selloffs—especially in luxury goods and technology—have quickly altered billionaire rankings and wealth totals.

## Key Findings
- **Bernard Arnault (LVMH):** Suffered a $32 billion YTD loss due to a 20% decline in LVMH’s shares, largely attributed to falling luxury demand and market volatility. He dropped in billionaire rankings as a result.
- **Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX, X):** Retains the top spot with ~$205B net worth, buoyed by Tesla’s resilience and broader tech sector strength in June 2024.
- **Jeff Bezos (Amazon):** Amazon shares edged higher, slightly increasing Bezos's estimated net worth to ~$203B and solidifying his #2 rank.
- **Biggest Single-Day Swings:** Apple posted a record $215 billion gain in one day. Berkshire Hathaway briefly plunged due to a technical glitch but trades were canceled.
- **Combined Top 10 Net Worth:** As of June 2024, the aggregate wealth of top 10 billionaires exceeds $1.6 trillion, with technology and luxury being the most volatile contributors.

## Detailed Analysis
### Company-Specific News
- **LVMH:** Market volatility and declining luxury demand, amplified by geopolitical uncertainty, triggered steep losses for Bernard Arnault. According to [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/this-billionaire-once-worlds-richest-lost-32-billion-in-2024-its-not-jeff-bezos-101734932700066.html), Arnault slipped from the #1 spot to as low as #5 among billionaires.
- **Tesla:** Tesla’s performance in June 2024 has kept Musk ahead of peers despite choppy overall markets. Core holdings in technology, both in Tesla and SpaceX, helped buffer some volatility.
- **Amazon:** Slight share price increases have protected Bezos from the drawdowns seen in luxury stocks.
- **Apple & Berkshire Hathaway:** Apple’s record single-day gain exemplifies how tech stocks can rapidly add to billionaire wealth. Warren Buffett’s wealth at Berkshire Hathaway briefly appeared to plummet due to a technical fault at NYSE, but no actual loss occurred as those trades were nullified ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-discount-deals-canceled/)).
