    "reasoning": "I do not have access to the content of the analysis reports; they were referenced as '[object Object]' and did not contain extractable information. Therefore, I am forced to assign neutral probabilities (50% yes, 50% no) due to insufficient evidence. If further details about the reports are provided, I can offer a more informed and accurate evaluation based on the actual contents."
