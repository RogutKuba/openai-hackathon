    "reasoning": "I am unable to see the actual content of the analysis reports because they are shown as '[object Object]'. Without access to the concrete content of these reports—such as data, arguments, or expert analysis—I cannot evaluate the strength, reliability, or relevance of the evidence presented. As a conservative and neutral approach in the absence of information, I must assign 50% probability to both ('yes' and 'no') outcomes. If you provide the specific content of the reports, I can reassess and offer a more precise and evidence-based probability estimate."
