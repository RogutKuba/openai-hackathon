    "reasoning": "I cannot directly interpret the 'Analysis Reports' as they appear as '[object Object]' rather than providing actual, readable data. Without access to specific evidence, details, or arguments from these reports, I must default to a neutral estimate. Therefore, I assign a 50% probability to both 'yes' and 'no' outcomes. For a more accurate assessment, I would need the actual content of the analysis reports to weigh the supporting and opposing evidence properly."
