    "reasoning": "I could not analyze the relevant evidence because the analysis reports were not provided in a readable format (they are listed as '[object Object]'). Without access to the underlying data or arguments within these reports, I am unable to weigh supporting or opposing evidence or assess the reliability of any claims. Therefore, I must remain neutral and assign equal probability to both 'yes' and 'no' outcomes, as there is no basis for a more informed judgment."
