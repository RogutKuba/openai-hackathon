# Report: Analysis of Real GDP Growth for Q2 2022 - Q4 2022 (BEA, Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate)

## Executive Summary
- **No available dataset provided contains quarterly, seasonally adjusted annual rate real GDP growth rates for Q2 2022 to Q4 2022.**
- All accessible datasets are either annual in frequency or do not cover the required time period (Q2 2022–Q4 2022).
- **It is not possible to determine* from the provided data* whether any quarter in Q2 2022–Q4 2022 had a real GDP growth rate below 0%.**
- To definitively answer the original query, *quarterly* real GDP data, directly from BEA (such as NIPA Table 1.1.1), is required.

## Methodology
**Data Sources Examined:**
- FRED series representing U.S. metropolitan GDP, both total and per capita, in real and nominal terms, as well as quantity indexes.
- Source datasets cover annual periods or have discontinued before 2022.
- Period of interest: **Q2 2022 to Q4 2022**, as per the query.
- Analysis cross-checked value coverage, frequency, and date range against the requirements.

## Key Findings
### 1. Data Frequency and Coverage
- All datasets analyzed (RGMPUSMP, NGMPUSMP, QGMPUSMP, PCRGMPUSMP) **only provide annual values or do not extend to the period in question**.
    - For example, RGMPUSMP gives values for 2022 and 2023, with no sub-annual breakdown.
    - PCRGMPUSMP is annual and ends in 2017.
- **No quarterly data for Q2 2022 to Q4 2022 exists within these datasets.**

### 2. Annual Trends
- The available annual data does show **positive growth** from 2022 to 2023 in all applicable series:
    - RGMPUSMP increased by 2.75% between 2022 and 2023.
    - NGMPUSMP increased by 6.88% over the same period.
- However, **annual growth does not imply positive growth in every quarter**, and quarterly downturns are possible despite annual increases.

### 3. Data Insufficiency for Quarterly Analysis
- None of the provided datasets have the temporal resolution necessary to *directly answer* if any quarter exhibited negative growth.
- This limitation applies to all examined fields: total real GDP, total nominal GDP, quantity indexes, and per capita figures.

## Detailed Analysis
### RGMPUSMP (Total Real GDP for US Metropolitan Portion)
- **Data span:** 2022, 2023 (annual)
- **Annual growth:** 2.75% increase
- **Limitation:** No quarterly figures; cannot split annual trend into Q2–Q4 quarters.

### NGMPUSMP (Total Nominal GDP for US Metropolitan Portion)
- **Data span:** 2022, 2023 (annual)
- **Annual growth:** 6.88% increase
- **Limitation:** Only annual data; quarterly trends not observable.

### PCRGMPUSMP (Per Capita Real GDP, Discontinued)
- **Ends in:** 2017
- **Relevance:** Not usable for periods after 2017; does not cover study interval.

### QGMPUSMP (Quantity Indexes for Real GDP)
- **Data available:** 2022 (annual only)
- **Limitation:** No quarterly or sub-annual points; not applicable for requested quarters.

### Cross-Comparison
- Positive annual growth in all series **suggests** no major recession for the full year 2022, but **this does not preclude one or more quarters having negative growth**.
- All series lack the necessary resolution to conclusively answer the query.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
### Summary
- **No conclusion can be drawn** from provided datasets about whether any quarter between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 had negative real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted at annual rate) according to the BEA.
- All datasets are either:
    - Only annual, or;
    - End before 2022, or;
    - Not specific to the granularity required.
- **Quarterly data is required for the original question.**

### Actionable Insights
- Procure relevant quarterly GDP data:
    - See BEA National Accounts, Table 1.1.1: "Percent Change From Preceding Period in Real Gross Domestic Product."
    - FRED GDP (quarterly, seasonally adjusted annual rate) can be found at [FRED GDPC1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).
- When evaluating sub-annual economic performance, always ensure frequency matches analytic needs.

### Future Considerations
- Always validate coverage and temporal frequency of economic datasets prior to in-depth analysis.
- For quarterly and more granular trends, source data directly from BEA quarterly releases or FRED series designed for sub-annual observation.
