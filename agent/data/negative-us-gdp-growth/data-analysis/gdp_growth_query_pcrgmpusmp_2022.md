The data series for Total Per Capita Real GDP United States Metropolitan Portion (DISCONTINUED) does not contain any records for 2022, and in fact, seems to be annual data ending at 2017. As a result, it cannot be used to directly answer the original query, which specifically asked for quarterly seasonally adjusted annual rate real GDP growth rates between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022.

**Key conclusions:**
1. The dataset does not cover the requested quarters (Q2 2022 - Q4 2022).
2. The data is annual, not quarterly, and appears to end in 2017.
3. For the original query, refer directly to BEA's official quarterly releases for real GDP growth rates for the United States, as this particular dataset (Total Per Capita Real GDP Metropolitan Portion) is not appropriate for that period or granularity.

**Recommendation:**
- Use the main BEA real GDP by expenditure data for quarterly growth rates. See BEA Table 1.1.1 for official quarterly real GDP growth figures.
