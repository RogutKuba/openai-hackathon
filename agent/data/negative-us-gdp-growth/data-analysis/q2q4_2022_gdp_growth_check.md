### Analysis of Real GDP Growth (Seasonally Adjusted at Annual Rate) for U.S. Metropolitan Portion: Q2 2022 to Q4 2022

- **Data Series Examined:** Total Real Gross Domestic Product for United States Metropolitan Portion (RGMPUSMP)
- **Timeframe:** The data in the available file is annual, covering 2022 and 2023 (i.e., period start dates 2022-01-01 and 2023-01-01).

#### Annual Growth Calculation
- **2022 Value:** $19,896,599.724
- **2023 Value:** $20,436,284.297
- **Annual growth rate:** \[((20436284.297 - 19896599.724) / 19896599.724) * 100 ≈ 2.75%\]

#### Quarterly Breakdown
- The CSV data available does **not** provide quarterly (Q2, Q3, or Q4 2022) breakdowns—**only annual values are present**.
- Therefore, we cannot directly determine if any specific quarter between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 had a seasonally adjusted annual rate real GDP growth rate below 0%.

#### Conclusion (Relevance to Original Query)
- **No inference about quarterly negative GDP growth is possible** for this series and timeframe with the supplied data.
- For quarterly insight, you would need data with quarterly frequency, not annual.

**Recommendation:**
- If the intent is to check quarterly negative growth, you should obtain the relevant FRED/BEA data with quarterly granularity. The series analyzed here does not suffice for that purpose.
