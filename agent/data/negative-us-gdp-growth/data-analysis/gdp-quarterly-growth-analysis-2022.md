### Analysis of GDP Growth Rate (Q2 2022-Q4 2022) for U.S. Metropolitan Portion

#### Data Availability
- The provided dataset only contains annual data (one value per year) for the series "Total Quantity Indexes for Real GDP for United States Metropolitan Portion."
- There are no quarterly observations between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 in this dataset; only the value for the full year 2022 is present (112.926, as of 2022-01-01).

#### Relevance to Original Query
- The original query asked whether any quarter between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 had a seasonally adjusted at annual rate real GDP growth rate below 0% according to the BEA.
- Because the dataset only lists annual, not quarterly, quantities, it is impossible to determine quarterly growth or any sub-annual periods from this data.
- **No conclusion about negative quarterly GDP growth between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 can be drawn from this data.**

#### Recommendation
- To answer the original query accurately, quarterly data with seasonally adjusted annual rates should be obtained, ideally directly from the BEA or FRED's quarterly GDP releases.
