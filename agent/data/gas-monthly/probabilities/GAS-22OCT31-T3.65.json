    "reasoning": "The market outcome 'GAS-22OCT31-T3.65' appears to relate to whether the official U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline was equal to or greater than $3.65 per gallon on October 31, 2022. The analysis reports clearly state, and confirm with official FRED (GASREGW) data, that the price on October 31 was $3.742 per gallon. This is above $3.65. However, based on the format of prediction market questions with a code like 'T3.65,' it is likely the market is about whether the price exceeded (True/Yes) $3.65 on that date. With the actual price being $3.742, the evidence is unambiguous; the probability of 'yes' is 100%. Double-checking the market question wording: if, for any reason, the question is instead whether the price was below $3.65, the outcome would be 'no' with 100% probability. The reports are reliable official data. Given the clarity and direct relevance of the data, and with no conflicting information, I assign 100% probability to the outcome supported by the official price. If the market outcome is explicitly 'Was the price above $3.65?', the probability of 'yes' is 100%; if it is 'Was the price below $3.65?', the probability of 'no' is 100%. There is no ambiguity given the provided price."
