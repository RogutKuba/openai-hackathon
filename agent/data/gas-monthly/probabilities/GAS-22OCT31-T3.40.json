    "reasoning": "The market in question (GAS-22OCT31-T3.40) is likely structured as a binary outcome on whether the official US average gasoline price on October 31, 2022, was at or above $3.40 per gallon (likely 'yes' if ≥$3.40, otherwise 'no'). The provided analysis reports authoritatively state that the average price on that date was $3.742 per gallon, well above the $3.40 threshold. This figure is backed by FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), a highly reliable source, and backed by weekly data snapshots directly referencing October 31, 2022. No information in the reports contradicts that the observed price was well above the cut line. Therefore, the probability of the 'yes' outcome (price ≥$3.40) is 100%, and 'no' (price < $3.40) is 0%. Given the instructions to be conservative, but also to weigh the reliability and clarity of the data (which is unambiguous), the assignment is 'yes': 100%, 'no': 0%. However, the response field structure requested the probabilities presented reflecting which outcome is likely. Assuming the market resolves to 'yes' if above $3.40, that is the only plausible outcome."
