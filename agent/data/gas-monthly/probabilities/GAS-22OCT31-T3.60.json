    "reasoning": "The market outcome to evaluate is GAS-22OCT31-T3.60. Based on the report, the official U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline on October 31, 2022, was $3.742 per gallon. This price is clearly above $3.60. The report provides a detailed and reliable week-by-week breakdown from a reputable source (FRED), showing consistent prices above $3.60 throughout the period analyzed. There is no conflicting or ambiguous dataâ€”every piece of evidence confirms that the price on the specified date exceeded $3.60. Therefore, the probability that the price was $3.60 or below ('yes' outcome) is 0%, and the probability it was over $3.60 ('no' outcome) is 100%."
