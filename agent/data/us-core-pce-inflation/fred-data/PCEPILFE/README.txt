Index is a measure of the prices that people living in the United
States, or those buying on their behalf, pay for goods and services.
The change in the PCE price index is known for capturing inflation (or
deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflecting
changes in consumer behavior. For example, if car prices rise, car
sales may decline while bicycle sales increase.   The PCE Price Index
is produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which revises
previously published PCE data to reflect updated information or new
methodology, providing consistency across decades of data that's
valuable for researchers. They also offer the series as a Chain-Type
index and excluding food and energy products, as above. The PCE price
index less food excluding food and energy is used primarily for
macroeconomic analysis and forecasting future values of the PCE price
index.  The PCE Price Index is similar to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' consumer price index for urban consumers. The two indexes,
which have their own purposes and uses, are constructed differently,
resulting in different inflation rates.  For more information on the
PCE price index, see: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Guide to the
National Income and Product Accounts of the United States (NIPA)
