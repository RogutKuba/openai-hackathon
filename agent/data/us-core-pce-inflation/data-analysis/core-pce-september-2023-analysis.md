### Core PCE Inflation Analysis for September 2023

#### Data Observed
- **August 2023 Core PCE Index**: 119.658
- **September 2023 Core PCE Index**: 120.040

#### Month-over-Month Percent Change Calculation
The month-over-month percent change is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percent Change} = \frac{\text{120.040} - \text{119.658}}{\text{119.658}} \times 100 
\]

\[
= \frac{0.382}{119.658} \times 100 \approx 0.319\%
\]

#### Focus on Single-Decimal Value
- To one decimal place, the percent change is **0.3%**
- The value is **not above 0.3%**; it rounds exactly to 0.3% with two significant digits. The unrounded value (~0.319%) is just below 0.32%.

#### Insight
- For September 2023, the core PCE month-over-month inflation rate is **0.3%** (single-decimal), **not above 0.3%**.
- This suggests modest monthly price growth, and is broadly in line with recent trends.

#### Context
- Core PCE is a widely watched measure by the Federal Reserve for underlying inflation. Monthly rates at or below 0.3% suggest moderate inflationary pressure.
- This is relevant for monetary policy and could imply a steady inflation trajectory unless future readings are significantly higher.

**Conclusion:** The single-decimal percent change for core PCE in September 2023 is 0.3%, and is not above the 0.3% threshold specified in the query.
