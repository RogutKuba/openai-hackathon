(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57218), this series was renamed from
"Natural Rate of Unemployment (Long-Term)" to "Noncyclical Rate of
Unemployment".  The natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is the rate
of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in
aggregate demand. Estimates of potential GDP are based on the
long-term natural rate. (CBO did not make explicit adjustments to the
short-term natural rate for structural factors before the recent
downturn.) The short-term natural rate incorporates structural factors
that are temporarily boosting the natural rate beginning in 2008. The
short-term natural rate is used to gauge the amount of current and
projected slack in labor markets, which is a key input into CBO's
projections of inflation.
