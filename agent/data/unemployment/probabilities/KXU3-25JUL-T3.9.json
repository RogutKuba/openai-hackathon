    "reasoning": "I do not have access to the content of the analysis reports, as they are listed only as [object Object]. Without concrete data or evidence from the reports, I cannot reasonably weigh the supporting or opposing evidence for the market outcome. In the absence of substantive information, a conservative approach is to assign equal probabilities of 50% to both 'yes' and 'no' outcomes, reflecting a lack of basis for favoring either. If specific report details are provided, I can offer a far more informed and nuanced evaluation."
