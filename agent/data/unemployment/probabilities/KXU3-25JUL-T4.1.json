    "reasoning": "I am unable to access or interpret the contents of the analysis reports because they appear as '[object Object]' without any specific information or evidence provided. Without access to concrete evidence or detailed analysis, I cannot reasonably favor either outcome. Therefore, I assign a neutral estimate of 50% to both 'yes' and 'no' probabilities, acknowledging the absence of meaningful data to inform a more precise assessment. If you provide the full text or details of the analysis reports, I can offer a more informed probability breakdown."
