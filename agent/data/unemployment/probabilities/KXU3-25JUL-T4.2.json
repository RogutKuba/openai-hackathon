    "reasoning": "The analysis reports referenced ([object Object]) were not included or are not visible, so I do not have access to the underlying data or arguments. Without any concrete evidence from the provided reports, I cannot assign any informed, evidence-based probability to the 'yes' or 'no' outcome. In this case, the most conservative and methodologically sound approach is to assign a 50% probability to both outcomes, reflecting complete uncertainty in the absence of specific data."
